# Yuviii.in

My personal portfolio website documenting what I build, why I build it, and how I use modern full-stack and AI technologies to create real-world systems.

## About
This website serves as a central place to showcase my projects, experience, and engineering approach.  
The focus is on clean design, clarity, and practical implementation rather than noise or overengineering.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Framer Motion (subtle animations)

## Design Philosophy
- Dark, minimal, and consistent UI
- Performance-first and responsive
- Modern React patterns with clean component structure
- Built to evolve as my skills and projects grow
